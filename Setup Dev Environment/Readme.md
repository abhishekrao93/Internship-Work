# Setup-development-environment
The Repository is created to track the internship activities at ITIC


## TO DO :

-Install virtualenv and create a test virtual environment.

-Install Jupyter Notebook on the virtual environment using pip.

-Load up the following dataset into a Jupyter notebook.

-Draw a bar chart of the "quality rating column" using matplotlib.

-Repeat the whole process again, but this time use Google Colab Notebooks instead of running your own notebook. How did you load up the dataset this time?


### Steps to Install Python on the machine
1) Install the python application file from https://www.python.org/downloads/ website.
2) Run the executable installer and follow the steps.
3) To check if python is installed on the machine, navigate to command prompt and type python. You should get the current verison of python. 
    e.g :  "Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
            Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information."
4) Add python to path variable using the below steps: 
    a) Navigate to system properties using :: control panel --> System and security --> System --> Advanced System Setting
    b) Navigate to environment variable tab , check the system variable section and find the PATH variable. 
    c) click on the edit button and add your python path . 
        e.g. "C:\Users\abhis\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\"
